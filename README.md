# CPU Scheduling Simulator (C)

This project is a CPU scheduling simulator written in C that implements
classic operating system scheduling algorithms.

It simulates process execution and computes key scheduling metrics such as
waiting time, turnaround time, and response time, along with a textual
Gantt chart visualization.
